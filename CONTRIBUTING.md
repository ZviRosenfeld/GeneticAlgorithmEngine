Want to fix a bug or add a new feature? That's great.

Before stating, you should open an issue so that everyone's on the same page. 
Mention in the issue that you'd like to solve it, and outline your suggested solution.

### Coding Conventions

- Names should be meaningful (e.g. use time, and not t).
- Don't use cruelly brakes for one line conditions or loops.
- Public property names should start with an uppercase letter (e.g. Property).
- Private fields should start with a lowercase letter (e.g. field).
- Methods should always start with an uppercase letter (e.g. Method).
- When a method or variable name contains more then one word, use uppercase letter  to split the words (twoWords).

### Unit Tests

If subtitle, you should add unit tests that cover your new code. In this project MsTest is used as a unit test framework, and FakeItEasy as a mocking framework. Please don't use other frameworks for these purpose.
